The Thomas Paine National Historical Association is offering
memberships to those who are interested in the founding father and
global revolutionary Thomas Paine - his life, works, and
legacy. Membership provides an opportunity for you to help support:

- the vital work of producing the first official, international Collected Works of Paine
- the historical Thomas Paine Memorial Building in New Rochelle, NY
- the creation of the Thomas Paine International Historical Center in New Rochelle, NY: a complex consisting of our Thomas Paine Memorial Building, the Paine Monument, the Paine Cottage, and eventually the restored gravesite
- educational efforts such as the proposed biennial conference at the Thomas Paine International Historical Center in New Rochelle
- strengthening the only reliable, accurate authority on Paine's life, works, and legacy
- efforts to broaden public, political, and educational awareness of Paine's role as the pre-eminent founder of the democratic, secular ethos of humanity

<p>
The Huguenot & New Rochelle Historical Association, owners of The Thomas Paine Cottage Museum, is a separate organization, which we collaborate with,
but we have different memberships at present. If interested in one, you should support the other as well. Visit <a href="http://www.thomaspainecottage.org">their website</a> for membership.
